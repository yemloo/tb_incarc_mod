# Mass incarceration as a driver of the tuberculosis epidemic in Latin America

## Overview

In Latin America, increasing punitive policies since the 1990s have resulted in massive growth in the region's prison population. This has contributed to a worsening crisis of tuberculosis in prisons. Yet, the role of incarceration as a tuberculosis driver transcends effects observable within prisons. In this study, we quantify the full impact of incarceration on the tuberculosis epidemic in Latin America using a dynamic, meta-population, compartmental transmission model to account for the dynamic nature of incarceration and its effects beyond prison walls. Specifically, we estimate the excess population tuberculosis burden attributable to the historical rise in incarceration rates and project the impact of alternative incarceration policies on future tuberculosis incidence. This repository contains model code, data and parameter inputs, and calibration and analysis scripts for the study.
